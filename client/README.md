# Client / Mobile application

Start the Expo application with:

`npm run start` or `npm run tunnel` (when connecting from a different network)

It may be necessary to `npm install` before or to install some specific libraries for Expo.

Then only scan the QR code generated by Expo and open the application with the Expo Go application on your device.
